**IN DETAILED - lEARNING AND KEY INSIGHTS , WHILE MAKING PROJECT**

In this Power BI project, I have created a **Comprehensive Financial Insights Dashboard** to analyze and compare the income statement across two years, incorporating key financial metrics. Below is a detailed explanation of the process, insights, and features:

### 1. Data Transformation and Cleaning :
   - **Data Import**: You imported the raw financial data using Power BI's **Power Query** editor.
   - **Data Cleaning**: The data required preprocessing to ensure accuracy. You:
     - **Combined and Renamed Columns**: Some columns were merged or renamed for better readability and usability.
     - **Queries**: Additional necessary queries were added to adjust the structure of the dataset, enabling the required calculations for financial metrics.

### 2. Data Model and DAX Calculations :
   - After cleaning the data, you created a **data model** by linking different tables and columns for effective relationships.
   - **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: 
     - You wrote several DAX measures to calculate key financial metrics:
       - **Revenue**: Capturing total sales.
       - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Calculating the cost associated with the production of goods.
       - **EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)**: Subtracting expenses from gross profit to determine profitability.
       - **Gross Profit**: Calculated by subtracting COGS from revenue, showing the profit before deducting operating expenses.
     - These measures were critical in generating accurate financial insights and calculating various business performance metrics.
   
### 3. Visuals and Slicers :
   - You used **different visuals and slicers** to showcase financial data for the selected years (2019 and 2020) and regions (East, North, South, West). This allows users to filter data dynamically.
   - **Comparison of Current and Previous Year Data**: 
     - The dashboard compares metrics from the current year (2020) with the previous year (2019). Percentage change is visualized for each category to highlight financial performance.
     - Visuals include:
       - **Revenue**: Showing both the absolute value and percentage change.
       - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Displays how costs have varied year-over-year.
       - **Gross Profit, Expenses, EBIT, Tax, Net Income**: All these metrics are laid out similarly, with both numerical values and trend lines for better analysis.
   
### 4. Net Income Margin :
   - A **Net Income Margin Donut Chart** represents the profitability percentage for the selected time period. This KPI shows how much of the total revenue results in profit after all expenses, giving an immediate sense of business efficiency.

### 5. Tools Utilized :
   - **Power Query**: For data cleaning, transformation, and combining queries.
   - **Data Models**: To create relationships between tables for efficient analysis.
   - **DAX**: To write formulas and measures to calculate financial insights (e.g., COGS, EBIT, Gross Profit).
   - **Visuals and Slicers**: To build interactive and dynamic reports, enabling year and region-based comparisons.
   - **Report Builder**: For the final layout, formatting, and visual presentation of the dashboard.

### Key Learning and Insights:
   - **Data Transformation**: Handling messy financial data by performing necessary transformations to ensure a clean and robust dataset.
   - **Financial Calculations**: Gained hands-on experience calculating and visualizing core financial KPIs (like Revenue, Gross Profit, EBIT, and Net Income).
   - **Visual Storytelling**: The dashboard provides an intuitive comparison of financial performance across two years, with clear percentage changes, enabling decision-makers to identify trends quickly.
   - **User Interactivity**: By adding slicers, you made the dashboard flexible for users to filter by year and region, improving the analysis.

This project highlights your ability to clean, model, and analyze financial data, while presenting it in an easily interpretable and dynamic dashboard, which is critical for financial analysis and decision-making.
